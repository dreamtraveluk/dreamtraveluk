*****************************Rain effect*****************************

Absolutely stunning real rain
(it's like raindrops faling on your screen - stuff behind the rain gets distorted. Could use this as the background, and then put our actual text/photos/etc over it)
(second thoughts: seems massively complicated, not worth the effort if it refuses to work straight away)
https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/11/04/rain-water-effect-experiments/

Very simple rain/snow (pixels / strings of pixels falling diagonally across the page)
(unimpressive, but easy)
http://dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex3/rain.htm

Rather plain CSS-only rain
https://codemyui.com/configurable-rain-effect-css/

Rather plain CSS & javascript rain (quite similar to the above)
https://codepen.io/alemesre/pen/hAxGg

CSS and javascript rain (doesn't look impressive/nice)
http://jsbin.com/diraqoni/3/edit?html,css,js,output


Real raindrops - alright. Slow etc.

Nice good real rain

Simpler, less nice version of the above

Beautiful/simple autumn leaves effect (+a plow comes to clean them up!)
http://www.mf2fm.com/rv/dhtmlautumnleaves.php

Simple red leaves, rotate etc.

Erratic leaves

*****************************Change cursor when you hover over specific things*****************************

CSS-only custom cursors (very easy)

*****************************Embed weather widget*****************************

Seems okay:
https://www.accuweather.com/en/free-weather-widgets

	Within the above, "current weather" widget seems best (nice and simple, which most others are not)
	https://www.accuweather.com/en/free-weather-widgets/current

Less nice, I think:
